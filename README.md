# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Hooks Definition
New addition in React 16.8. 

## Hooks concepts
1)useState
2)useEffect
3)useContext
4)useRef
5)useMemos
6)usecallBack


## state Hook....
Declare a new state variable,
which will be Call "Count"
## Const [Count,Setcount]=Usestate(0);

## Declaring a Multistate var....
Const[age,Setage]=useState(42);
Const[fruit,Setfruit]=Usestate('Green grapes')
Const[todos,SetTodos]=Usestate([{text:'Learn Hook'}]);

## Using the State Hook....
Const Example =(Props)=>{
//You can use Hooks Here!
return<div/>;
}

(or)
<>
function Example(Props){
//You Can Use Hooks Here!
return<div/>
}
## Use Reducer
The useReducer Hook is similar to the useState Hook.

It allows for custom state logic.

If you find yourself keeping track of multiple pieces of state that rely on complex logic, useReducer may be useful.

## Syntax
The useReducer Hook accepts two arguments.

useReducer(<reducer>, <initialState>)

The reducer function contains your custom state logic and the initialStatecan be a simple value but generally will contain an object.

The useReducer Hook returns the current stateand a dispatchmethod.
